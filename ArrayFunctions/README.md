Array Operations

Overview
This Java project processes an array of integers input by the user. It provides functionalities to display the array, find the smallest difference between consecutive elements, and separate even and odd numbers.

Components
1. UserInput.java
- Captures user input for an array of five integers.
- Returns an integer array.

2. ArrayFunctions.java
- display(ArrayList<Integer> array): Prints the contents of an ArrayList.
- diffArray(int[] array): Finds and prints the smallest difference between consecutive elements in the array.
- evenOdd(int[] array): Separates and prints even and odd numbers from the array.

3. Main.java
- Main driver class that:
  - Receives user input.
  - Calls the ArrayFunctions class methods for various operations.
  - Displays the results.

Execution Steps
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the Java files:
   javac Main.java
3. Run the program:
   java Main
4. Enter 5 integers when prompted.
5. View the results, including array display, smallest difference, and even-odd separation.
